They discover that the ""monster"" which they searched for is in reality the first man-made submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by Captain Nemo, a madman who is willing to share his secrets of nuclear energy with the world only on his own terms. Land rescues Nemo from the clutches of a giant squid and eventually manages to alert the outside world as to the location of Nemo's secret island base. Nemo and his creations are destroyed. Released on December 23, 1954. Based on the classic story by Jules Verne. Academy Award winner for Best Special Effects and Best Art Decoration/Set Decoration (John Meehan and Emile Kuri); nominated also for Best Film Editing. 127 min. The first Disney feature filmed in CinemaScope. Disney special effects wizards constructed the giant squid of rubber, steel spring, flexible tubing, glass cloth, Lucite, and plastic, with tentacles measuring 40 feet with two feelers of 50 feet. It could rear up eight feet out of water, its tentacles and feelers moving with frightening realism. It took a staff of 28 men to operate the intricate remote controls. Using hydraulics, electronics, and compressed air, they succeeded in giving a lifelike appearance to the squid. But there were problems. The squid fight had to be filmed a second time after Walt Disney and the director, Richard Fleischer, were unhappy with the initial results. It had been filmed in a special tank on brand-new soundstage 3 at the Disney Studio as if it was sunset on a placid sea; unfortunately this allowed viewers to see too much of the mechanics that enabled the squid to move, and it looked too fake. Instead, the scene was shot a second time, as if it was a stormy night, with 100 backstage workers on hand providing the needed lightning, rain, turbulent seas, and hurricane winds, and everything worked much better. The movie featured the song, ""A Whale of a Tale"" by Al Hoffman and Norman Gimbel. Director Fleischer was the son of Walt's early animation rival, Max Fleischer, who created the Out of the Inkwell and Betty Boop cartoons, and Disney made sure that Max did not object before he hired his son. Stars James Mason (Capt. Nemo), Kirk Douglas (Ned Land), Paul Lukas (Prof. Aronnax), Peter Lorre (Conseil). Locations for the film included the Disney and 20th Century-Fox lots in California, and various locales in the Bahamas and Jamaica. The Nautilus was designed by Harper Goff. Reissued in theaters in 1963 and 1971. Released on video in 1980, 1985, and 1992. A television show on the making of the film, Operation Undersea, won the Emmy for best television program of the year. The Nautilus set was displayed for a time at Disneyland."

This was the last of the several package pictures of the 1940s, during which the Walt Disney Studio had deep economic problems.

Henceforth, Walt Disney would be able to finance the production of regular, one-story, animated features, beginning the next year with Cinderella. Its success ensured the continuation of animation at the Studio.

However, in order to be considered for the position, Jimmy needs to prove that he knows how to recruit star talent. Since all the best players are signing with competing schools, the chances for Jimmy's advancement look bleak until he gets the wild idea to scout for a wonder player in Africa. In Kenya he discovers a tall Winabi warrior, Saleh, who cannot be dazzled by fast-talking recruiting techniques and promises of wonderful gifts and flashy cars. Jimmy's high-pressure techniques clash with the local customs, but he is finally able to prove himself when the tables are turned and he himself is recruited by the Winabi to help coach their misfit team so they can beat the team of a neighboring tribe, the Mingori, in a game with extremely high stakes-the Winabi's land, their cattle, and the future of the tribe.

44,Aladdin,a-to-z/aladdin-film/,"Animated feature about a street-smart young thief in the mythical city of Agrabah who meets and falls in love with the Sultan's beautiful daughter, Jasmine, a liberated young lady who seeks to escape her present lifestyle. Help comes when the evil vizier, Jafar, plots to get a magic lamp for his own rise to power, and decides he needs Aladdin, a true ""diamond in the rough,"" to seek the lamp in the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin and his friend, the monkey Abu, gain the lamp and the wise-cracking Genie inside for themselves. The Genie changes Aladdin into a prince so he can woo the princess, but the deception fails to impress Jasmine. As his true self, however, he uses his cunning and courage, with the help of the Genie, to defeat Jafar and his evil plans, in the end earning a princely title and the princess. Initial release on November 11, 1992; general release on November 25, 1992. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. 90 min. Aladdin has a speaking voice provided by Scott Weinger and a singing voice by Brad Kane. Other voices are Robin Williams (Genie), Jonathan Freeman (Jafar), Linda Larkin (Jasmine speaking), Lea Salonga (Jasmine singing), and Gilbert Gottfried (Iago). The idea of adapting the Aladdin story as a Disney animated musical was first proposed by Howard Ashman in 1988 when he and Alan Menken were still working on The Little Mermaid. He wrote an initial treatment and collaborated on six songs with Menken, including ""Arabian Nights,"" ""Friend Like Me,"" and ""Prince Ali."" After Ashman's death in 1991, Tim Rice came on board to write some additional songs, notably ""One Jump Ahead"" and ""A Whole New World."" The art directors were influenced by Persian miniatures and Arabian calligraphy. Supervising animator Eric Goldberg, who created the Genie, was the first animator to work on the project. He was heavily influenced by the curved, fluid caricature style of artist Al Hirschfeld. Computer-generated imagery enabled the filmmakers to create the amazing magic carpet ride through the Cave of Wonders, the intricately-patterned carpet itself, and the stunning tiger head cave. The film won Academy Awards for Best Song (""A Whole New World"") and Best Original Score. The film became the highest grossing animated film to date, earning over $200 million domestically. The video release in 1993 also set records. There were two made-for-video sequels-The Return of Jafar and Aladdin and the King of Thieves."

So, some of the footage detailing the everyday home life of Eskimos in a typical village was edited together to become this first People and Places featurette, the forerunner of a number of such travelogues.

Songs include ""All in the Golden Afternoon,"" and ""I'm Late,"" by Bob Hilliard and Sammy Fain, and ""The Unbirthday Song,"" by Mack David, Al Hoffman, and Jerry Livingston. 75 min. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture. This animated feature had been on Walt Disney's mind since 1933, when he considered a live action version starring Mary Pickford. He shelved the project after Paramount made a version, but later had artist David Hall, a Hollywood artist and designer, create some concepts for an all-animated film. World War II intervened, and it was not until the late 1940s that work began again in earnest. One of Walt's big problems with this film was that here he was dealing with a highly regarded classic, and what was charming and appropriately bizarre in book form seemed oddly out of place on the motion picture screen. Walt's feeling, expressed in later years, was that Alice had no ""heart."" An edited version aired on television on November 3, 1954. The film was rediscovered by the psychedelic generation, when it was made available on 16mm for schools, and it was rereleased in theaters in 1974 and 1981.

World premiere in London on August 9, 1942; released in the U.S. on August 13, 1942. Based on the book by Felix Salten. The supervising director was David Hand.

Includes the songs ""Love Is a Song"" and ""Little April Shower,"" written by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey. The film had been put into production as work on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was winding down. But the story of Bambi was different from anything else the Studio had ever attempted. It was more serious, and all the characters were animals. In striving for realism, the artists heard lectures from animal experts, made field trips to the Los Angeles Zoo, watched specially filmed nature footage shot in the forests of Maine, and even studied the movements of two fawns that were donated to the Studio. The meticulous work was time-consuming; even taking care to see that the spots on the fawn's back remained constant meant fewer drawings could be finished in a day. The film moved exceedingly slowly through the production process, but Walt was delighted with the results he was seeing. ""Fellas, this stuff is pure gold,"" he told the animators. Bambi was released at a difficult time, with the United States deep in World War II, so its initial profits were low, but the story of the little deer coming of age has endured, and today, Bambi is universally regarded as one of Walt Disney's most charming films. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Sound, Best Song (""Love Is a Song""), and Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. 70 min. It was rereleased in theaters in 1942, 1947, 1957, 1966, 1975, 1982, 1988. Released on video in 1989 and 1997."

Angela Lansbury sang the title song in the story, and Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson sang another rendition over the film's end credits. Since lyricist Howard Ashman had died earlier in the year, the film was dedicated to him: ""To our friend, Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful.""

Portions of the film were animated at Disney's satellite facility at Disney-MGM Studios in Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

It was Ashman who came up with the idea of turning the enchanted objects into living creatures with unique personalities. Glen Keane, the supervising animator on Beast, created his own hybrid beast by combining the mane of a lion, the beard and head structure of a buffalo, the tusks and nose bridge of a wild boar, the heavily muscled brow of a gorilla, the legs and tail of a wolf, and the big and bulky body of a bear. Computer-generated imagery was used in several parts of the film, most notably in the ""Be Our Guest"" sequence and in the creation of a striking three-dimensional ballroom background, allowing dramatic camera moves on the animated characters as they danced. It became the most successful animated feature in motion picture history up to that time, with domestic box office revenues in excess of $140 million. Released on video in 1992. The film was reissued in IMAX and other giant screen theaters on January 1, 2002, featuring the song ""Human Again"" in a never-before-seen animated sequence. New running time 90 min.

With the help of three London children, who she takes in to save them from the blitz, she first seeks out her amusing but bogus professor of witchcraft, Emelius Browne, and then ventures into Portobello Road in search of the rare formula. Miss Price finally discovers that the words of the magical spell can be found on the legendary ""Lost Isle of Naboombu,"" so she, Browne, and the children travel there, having adventures beneath the sea along the way. They discover the lion king of Naboombu is wearing a medallion with the words to the spell on it, which they have to obtain. All of this magical travel is possible with the aid of a magical bedknob. Returning home, Miss Price uses the formula to raise a ghostly army of armor from the local museum that routs a band of invading German commandos. Premiered in England on October 7, 1971; U.S. general release on December 13, 1971.

Heller), Bruce Forsyth (Swinburne), Tessie O'Shea (Mrs. Hobday), Reginald Owen (Gen. Teagler), Ian Weighill (Charlie), Roy Snart (Paul), Cindy O'Callaghan (Carrie). The creative talent behind Mary Poppins joined forces again for this film, including producer-writer Bill Walsh, director Robert Stevenson, songwriters Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, music supervisor Irwin Kostal, art director Peter Ellenshaw, and special effects technician Eustace Lycett. The songs included: ""The Old Home Guard,"" ""Eglantine,"" ""The Age of Not Believing,"" ""Portobello Road,"" ""The Beautiful Briny,"" and ""Substitutiary Locomotion."" One song sung by Angela Lansbury on the sound track record album, ""A Step in the Right Direction,"" was edited out of the film just before its release. The screenplay was based on Mary Norton's book, with additions by Bill Walsh, who came up with the German invasion. The film was made entirely on the Disney Studio lot in Burbank, California, where outdoor sets included the town of Pepperinge Eye and Miss Price's seaview cottage, and indoor sets including a three-block section of London's legendary Portobello Road. Two hundred players jammed this set alone, which was filled with bric-a-brac and such oddments as a Sicilian sedan chair, Limoges china, and gas masks from World War II. Among the performers and extras in the crowd were veterans of music halls, vaudeville, rep shows, radio, silent films, and early talkies. The ghostly medieval army's weapons and armor had originally been assembled in Spain for the film El Cid, and then were shipped to America to be used in the Warner Bros. musical Camelot. Ward Kimball was the director of the wonderful animation sequences on the Isle of Naboombu. Despite the effort, lavish budget, ingenuity, and special effects, the film was not a great box office success, causing the studio subsequently to edit the film. The editing was accomplished primarily to the detriment of musical numbers-large chunks of ""Eglantine"" and ""With A Flair"" were deleted. Academy Award winner for Best Special Visual Effects. The movie was nominated also for Best Art Direction/Set Direction, Best Song (""The Age of Not Believing""), Best Scoring, and Best Costume Design. The film remains a Disney favorite today, with a theatrical reissue in 1979 and releases on video in 1980, 1985, and 1989."

The production can be traced back to 1971, when the Disney Studio purchased the screen rights to Lloyd Alexander's The Chronicles of Prydain. The five-volume mythological fantasy had been published in the mid-1960s to critical acclaim and commercial success. Adapting Alexander's books with their numerous story lines and cast of over 30 major characters proved to be a time-consuming task. Several important writer/animators worked on the development of a screenplay through the 1970s until Joe Hale was named producer in 1980. He rewrote the script, capsulizing the sprawling story and making some changes. For instance, the Horned King was a minor character in the series but since he had so many possibilities, Hale expanded his role, making the villain a composite of several characters from the books. Filmmakers took advantage of the latest technology, which became essential in the completion of the film. Video cameras gave animators and directors an immediate and inexpensive record of what their efforts might look like. Computers also made inroads in the manipulation of solid inanimate objects on screen. The dimensions and volume of objects were fed into a computer and then their shapes were perfectly maintained as their movement was generated by programming. Disney's venerable multiplane cameras were updated with computers to expedite and control aperture settings and time exposures. Another technological breakthrough was the development of the APT (Animation Photo Transfer) process. The first major change in the Studio's method of transferring the artist's drawings to a cel since photocopying replaced hand inking 20 years earlier, the APT greatly improved the quality of the animator's art. In all, the animated film was 12 years in the making-five years in actual production-at the cost of over $25 million. Over 1,165 different hues and colors were implemented and over 34 miles of film stock was utilized. This was the first animated Disney film made in cooperation with Silver Screen Partners II. The sheer lavishness of the production, however, did not guarantee huge grosses, and the film was a box office failure. David W. Spencer was awarded an Academy Award for his development of the APT process. Released on video in 1998."

Nearly 14 months of simultaneous and postproduction filming and processing were required by the studio's photographic process laboratory and special effects departments. In some scenes, as many as 12 different photo processes were used simultaneously on the screen.

Wittliff, Lange fleshed out the basic plot of Country and met with farmers in the Midwest whose livelihoods had been threatened by forced foreclosures. The start of production saw cast and crew in a race against the elements to film an Iowa corn harvest. Sam Shepard took the controls of a massive gleaner-combine, which harvested the crop. Next the company moved onto the key set some 20 miles northeast of Waterloo in the farmlands of Iowa. There, a turn-of-the-century farmstead, slated to be demolished by its owner who wanted additional acreage for growing feed corn, became the Ivy farm. For three months the company worked 12-hour days capturing the reality of farm living. A secondary location was the rural hamlet of Readlyn, Iowa, with its giant grain elevators and broad main street. Winter arrived sooner than expected, and during the climactic auction sequence in which 100 local townspeople appeared, the wind chill factor steadied at 25 degrees below zero. Director Pearce could only film in five-minute segments before the Iowans had to break for the barn where red-hot butane heaters unsuccessfully attempted to warm the icy air.

Fearful of his daughter Katie's reaction and unwilling to give up his own standing in the community, he attempts to act as matchmaker to Michael and Katie to ensure their future. To help his plans, he captures his old friend King Brian of the leprechauns, who must grant Darby three wishes.

Inside the coach King Brian tricks Darby into making a fourth wish, which cancels out the previous ones, and sends Darby back to earth. Michael and Katie are married, and Darby is once again free to tell his tales of his little friends, the leprechauns. World premiere in Dublin, Ireland, on June 24, 1959; U.S. release on June 26, 1959. Directed by Robert Stevenson. 90 min. Based on H. T. Kavanagh's Darby O'Gill stories, the film stars Albert Sharpe in the title role, with co-stars Janet Munro (Katie O'Gill), Jimmy O'Dea (King Brian), Sean Connery (Michael McBride), Estelle Winwood (Sheelah), Kieron Moore (Pony Sugrue), Walter Fitzgerald (Lord Fitzpatrick). With this film Janet Munro was signed to a Studio contract, but for Connery it would be three years before stardom would come with the James Bond series. The movie was director Stevenson's first major production, and on the strength of this assignment, he went on to direct many of the Studio's biggest hits in the 1960s. The film's production at the Studio began in the mid-1940s when Walt Disney discovered the stories, and in 1946 he sent artists to Ireland for background material, following himself soon afterward. He had a fondness for the country because his ancestors had come from there. The songs ""The Wishing Song"" and ""Pretty Irish Girl"" were written by Oliver Wallace and Lawrence E. Watkin. With the aid of lavish matte shots, the film was shot entirely in California. To film the forced perspective of the leprechauns' throne room, there was a need for huge sets, lit by many banks of lights, necessitating the building of an entire new soundstage at the Disney Studio. Special effects masters Peter Ellenshaw, Eustace Lycett, and Joshua Meador concocted the magic of the leprechauns and their appeal was undeniable. Leprechaun means ""little body"" in Gaelic, and according to legend they are 21 inches tall, usually dressed in grass green, 5,000 years old, and immeasurably wealthy. Walt Disney dedicated the film, in the opening credits, to these very believable Little People: ""My thanks to King Brian of Knocknasheega and his leprechauns whose gracious cooperation made this picture possible."" The movie features one of the scariest scenes ever to appear in a Disney movie-the wail of the hideous Banshee and the arrival of the dreaded Costa Bower. A television show to promote the film, I Captured the King of the Leprechauns, starred Walt Disney and Pat O'Brien. The motion picture was reissued in 1969 and 1977. Released on video in 1981 and 1992."

Premiered on November 13, 1940, at the Broadway Theater in New York. The film was presented in Fantasound, an early stereo system, devised at the Disney Studio, but which required theaters to be specially equipped. Because of the expense, the film originally opened in only 14 theaters. The stereo sound enhanced the effect of the movie and won special certificates for Walt Disney, technicians William Garity and John N. A. Hawkins and RCA, and for Leopold Stokowski and his associates (for unique achievement in the creation of a new form of visualized music) at the 1941 Academy Awards. 125 min. New interest in the film in the 1970s led to a new sound track in 1982, with the orchestra conducted by Irwin Kostal, narration by Hugh Douglas, and a recording in digital stereo, but its full-length restoration in 1990 brought back the original sound track, while trying to duplicate some of the effects of the Fantasound presentation. The film was re-released theatrically in 1946, 1956, 1963, 1969, 1977, 1982, 1985, and 1990. Released on video in 1991. Corey Burton replaced Deems Taylor on the DVD.

Production on The Fox and the Hound began in the spring of 1977, but it was delayed by the defection from the animation department of Don Bluth, Gary Goldman, John Pomeroy, and an additional group of animators who were unhappy at the Disney Studio and eager to set up their own studio and produce movies that they felt were more in line with the style and quality of movies that Disney used to make in its golden years. By the time The Fox and the Hound was finished, four years later, it would require approximately 360,000 drawings, 110,000 painted cels, 1,100 painted backgrounds, and a total of 180 people, including 24 animators. As in all Disney animated outings, music served to accentuate the action, highlight the humor, and, in general, enhance the story. The movie features the songs ""Best of Friends,"" by Richard O.

A total of 125 artists were involved in making the film. An innovative application of computer technology can be seen in the climactic scene where Basil faces Ratigan in a final confrontation inside the turning and thrashing gearworks of Big Ben.

858,Hercules,a-to-z/hercules-film/,"Hercules, the mighty son of Zeus and Hera, is taken from his Mount Olympus home and raised on Earth. The fiery figure behind Hercules's disappearance is Hades, the hot-headed god of the Underworld who has grown tired of looking after a ""bunch of deadbeats"" and sees Zeus's son as an obstacle to his plans to take over Olympus. Hades sends his two dim-witted sidekicks, Pain and Panic, to abduct Hercules, though they bungle their mission by not administering the final drop of a potent potion, which leaves the infant with god-like strength but human mortality. As Hercules grows up, he discovers the truth about his origins and sets out to prove himself a true hero (with the help of a veteran hero-training satyr named Philoctetes) so he can return to Olympus. Hades has other plans and tries to kill him by arranging a catalogue of calamities (a multiheaded Hydra, a Minotaur, a Cyclops, an army of Titans, and the traitorous damsel-in-distress, Megara). Along the way, Hercules discovers that a true hero is not measured by the size of his strength but the strength of his heart. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. General release on June 27, 1997, after a June 14 premiere at the New Amsterdam Theater in New York City, and a limited release beginning there the next day.

Music, with six songs in a pastiche of styles, including gospel, is by Alan Menken with lyrics by David Zippel. Musker and Clements were attracted by the mythological aspects of the Hercules story, and decided to produce the film, along with Alice Dewey, in the fall of 1993. Over the next nine months, the two collaborated on an outline, several treatments, and eventually an initial script, aided by art director Andy Gaskill, who oversaw the visual development on the film. British artist/political cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, with a bold, expressive linear style, was brought in to assist with character design, and he remained involved as an ongoing artistic adviser to the animators. A field trip to Greece and Turkey in the summer of 1994 gave artists a firsthand look at landscapes and ancient sites, and an opportunity to hear expert accounts of classic Greek mythology. Animation began in early 1995, and eventually a team of nearly 700 artists were involved with the project. The film features the first use in animation of the process of morphing, wherein an object is made to smoothly transform into another, utilizing computer technology. Released on video in 1998."

Calvin discovers that he has been summoned to the 12th century by Merlin to help restore Arthur's fading glory, and to prevent the realm from falling into the clutches of the sinister Lord Belasco. Calvin must find the courage to face Belasco and prove to himself that he has what it takes to be a worthy knight. Directed by Michael Gottlieb. A Walt Disney Picture in association with Tapestry Films and Trimark Pictures. Released on August 11, 1995. 90 min. Stars Thomas Ian Nicholas (Calvin Fuller), Joss Ackland (King Arthur), Ron Moody (Merlin), Art Malik (Lord Belasco). Kate Winslet, before becoming famous for her role in Titanic, played the role of Princess Sarah. To gain an authentic look, the producers decided to film in and around Budapest, Hungary. There they found a medieval castle and village set being used by a BBC television series that was on hiatus for the season. With a little redressing and redesigning, the set was just right. The production was truly international, for a final scene was filmed in England, the music was scored in Prague, and the final sound mix was done in Australia. An interesting bit of trivia-Ron Moody, who plays Merlin, played the same role for Disney 16 years earlier in Unidentified Flying Oddball. Released on video in 1996. A sequel, A Kid in Aladdin's Palace (1997), with Thomas Ian Nicholas reprising his role as Calvin Fuller, was made as a direct-to-video film by Trimark, and had its world television premiere on Disney Channel in March 1999."

The first Disney animated feature based on a classic fairy tale in three decades (since Sleeping Beauty), this film turned to the famous story by Hans Christian Andersen. Disney artists had considered an animated film of The Little Mermaid in the late 1930s, and illustrator Kay Nielsen prepared a number of striking story sketches in pastels and watercolors. For this film, the artists received inspiration from the Nielsen story sketches that were brought out of the Archives for them to study, and they gave Kay Nielsen a ""visual development"" credit on the film. Actress Sherri Stoner was the live-action model for Ariel. The film had more effects than probably any animated film since Fantasia; nearly 80 percent of the film required some kind of effects work-storms at sea, billowing sails, schools of fish, shadows, raging fire, explosions, magic pixie dust, surface reflections, underwater distortions, ripples, and bubbles.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences agreed too, giving it 13 nominations from which it won five Oscars for Best Actress (Julie Andrews), Best Song (""Chim Chim Cher-ee""), Best Music Score (the Sherman brothers), Best Film Editing (Cotton Warburton), and Best Special Visual Effects (Peter Ellenshaw, Eustace Lycett, and Hamilton Luske). There was also a special Scientific award to Petro Vlahos, Wadsworth E. Pohl, and Ub Iwerks for the creation and application to use of Color Traveling Matte Composite Cinematography, which helped make possible the combination of live action with animated actors in the film. The special-effects work on Mary Poppins was the most challenging the studio had ever known. Everything from the two-strip sodium process and piano wire to bungee cords were used to create the magical sequences. The work of the special-effects crew, as well as all the production staff, was the culmination of years of Disney innovation. In fact, only Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, the choreographers, and Irwin Kostal, musical arranger, had to be brought in from the outside; Disney staff members could be called upon for all of the other tasks. The entire film was shot on soundstages at the Disney Studio in Burbank. A lavish premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater on August 27, 1964, began its fabulous box office run that made it Disney's most successful feature until then. P. L. Travers, author of the popular books on which the film is based, continued writing new adventures for Mary Poppins long after the film, and in the late 1980s worked with a Disney screenwriter on a film sequel that never materialized. Reissued theatrically in 1973 and 1980; released on video in 1980 and kept available continuously. In 2004 a stage adaptation of Mary Poppins opened in England."

The first flight, with just Peter's family-Gunter's wife had convinced him to abandon the project-crashes just short of the border.

Moved by newspaper accounts of the daring escape, Disney executive Ron Miller and producer Tom Leetch contacted European story editor Eva Redfern with instructions to pursue the film rights. Impressed by the Disney television shows that were beamed from West to East Germany, the two couples accepted Disney's offer. The families flew to California to provide background material with the added inducement of a grand tour of Disneyland. To assure authenticity, the producers decided to film the entire production in West Germany in Landsberg, Muhltal, Harthausen, and Munich. Near the town of Eulenschwang production designer Rolf Zehetbauer and art director Herbert Strabel spent $300,000 to re-create a half-mile section of the border that separated East and West Germany, authentic down to the wire mesh fencing, concrete posts, automated shrapnel guns, leashed guard dogs, and impregnable cast iron barricades. One of the large exhibition halls at the I.B.O. fairgrounds, in Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance, was turned into the world's largest ""green set"" for filming scenes under controlled conditions. Within the 5,000-square-yard area, 300 pine trees were transplanted for the forest, and to shut out the light from the glass-walled structure, 6,000 square yards of black plastic covered the walls. The final cost for the set was $150,000. At the Bavaria Film Studio, interior filming was done on four sound stages. Gary Cerveny of Balloon Ventures, Inc. of Glendale, California, made and flew a total of seven hot-air balloons for the production. The balloons were re-created as closely as possible to the original. The only changes were in the material used and certain technical improvements to comply with FAA standards. What made the real-life flight all the more miraculous was that the experts say their balloon shouldn't have flown at all. With all the proper equipment, sophisticated electronic devices and human expertise, Cerveny had extreme difficulty getting the exact reproductions airborne. Released on video in 1982."

The Christmas spirit prevailed during the early stages of principal photography at a Toronto shopping center when more than 300 extras turned out for a Sunday shoot. At the location, 50 shopkeepers took down their current Valentine's Day decorations and replaced them with Christmas decor. The shopping center also offered a Santa Claus Village complete with Santa, a 20-piece brass band and an all-girl choir singing Christmas carols. In the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, all the residents in a three-block radius also joined in the true spirit of Christmas and happily bedecked their houses with seasonal decorations for the six days of filming in their area. Throughout the filming, as the production moved to the towns of Owen Sound and Meaford, the inconsistent weather nearly made filming impossible, as the crew faced rain, fog, sleet, blizzard, winds gusting up to 50 mph, mud, 15-foot snow drifts denying access to country locations and, often, zero visibility. Production designer Bill Brodie constructed three major sets: the Grainger house, the grandfather's home, and Santa's workshop and cottage, which was filled with real rare toys, insured for $1 million prior to filming, and 20,000 actual letters to Santa from the Toronto main post office.

The musical score was written by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn and included ""Candle on the Water,"" ""It's Not Easy,"" ""There's Room For Everyone,"" ""Brazzle Dazzle Day,"" ""In These Hills,"" ""Every Little Piece,"" and ""Passamaschloddy."" Animation art director Ken Anderson, animation director Don Bluth, and effects animator Dorse A. Lanpher were responsible for the ebullient animated dragon and his memorable interactions with the live actors. The story originated from writers Seton I. Miller and S. S. Field, who brought the property to Disney, where it was purchased years earlier, but it was not until 1975 that producer Jerome Courtland asked screenwriter Malcolm Marmorstein to adapt a screenplay. The Passamaquoddy town square and wharf area was constructed on the Disney Burbank Studio lot partly from the old Western set. Jack Martin Smith, the art director, face-lifted 30 existing buildings and constructed 8 more, with interiors designed on the Disney soundstages. The lighthouse for the film was built on a point above Morro Bay, California, substituting for Maine. It was equipped with a large Fresnell-type lighthouse lens, with a wickstand inside that caused a beacon of from 18 to 24 miles. In fact, it worked so well that Disney had to get special permission from the Coast Guard to operate it, since its operation would have confused passing ships. The domestic gross on the film's initial release was $18 million, a disappointment to the Disney Studio, which had hoped for another Mary Poppins success. The movie was nominated for Best Original Song (""Candle on the Water"") and Best Original Song Score, by Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn, and Irwin Kostal. Because of the disappointing box office, the film was cut from its original 135 minutes to 129 minutes during its initial run. A reissue appeared in 1984 that was edited further to 106 minutes. Released on video in 1980 and 1991."

It was so popular that the word Pollyanna even got into everyday usage, and eventually the dictionary, meaning someone who looks for the best in things. The film was director Swift's first Disney feature, and, in fact he appears briefly as the fireman scolding Jimmy Bean. With a then lavish $2.5 million budget, Swift gathered a crew and cast unlike any other Disney live-action feature. Disney set decorator Emile Kuri was on hand, but outsiders Walter Plunkett (costumes), Russell Harlan (cinematographer), and art directors Carroll Clark and Robert Clatworthy came from established careers at other studios. To find a house to use as the residence of Aunt Polly, Walt Disney had to go far afield from his Studio in Burbank. An ideal house was found in Santa Rosa, near the famed Napa Valley. It occupied a full block in the center of the town, and was surrounded by spacious lawns and gardens. It was built in 1877 as a replica of an old Natchez, Mississippi, antebellum house. The vintage train station and water hole were also filmed in Santa Rosa, but the interiors were completed at the Disney Studio. The film was released on video in 1982 and 1993.

The production required a team of more than 415 artists and technicians. Five key members of the creative team traveled to the Australian Outback to observe for themselves its unique beauty, which they wanted to capture on film. They came home with hundreds of photographs of Ayers Rock, Katherine Gorge, and Kakadu National Park, and countless filled sketchbooks. Since Jim Jordan, who had voiced the albatross Orville in the original The Rescuers, had passed away, it was Roy E. Disney who suggested the character of Wilbur, Orville's brother, as a replacement. The names, of course, were a play on the Wright Brothers. While the animation itself would be done by hand as it always has been, for the first time computer technology took the place of the Xerox process and the hand painting of cels (and it also enabled the inclusion of several spectacular visuals). The marketing effort for the film did not call attention to the fact that cels were not used, so that the film would be reviewed on its own merits and not in comparison to earlier Disney films. Released on video in 1991."

The production marked the culmination of three years of preparatory work and research in the United States and Britain. New systems of remote control, stop-motion photography, and a pioneering clay animation process created a wonderland that blended the realistic with the surreal. Sixteen weeks of shooting included interior work on five Elstree stages and filming on the studio lot. There was an additional location on Salisbury Plain, the site of Stonehenge. The production was the realization of Walt Disney's personal interest in the Oz stories by L. Frank Baum. On November 16, 1954, Disney purchased the rights to 11 of Baum's books from the author's son, Robert S. Baum. Originally the Oz stories were considered as the basis for a two-part television show in the Disneyland series and in April 1957 the studio hired Dorothy Cooper to write a preliminary outline of the story. Her original storyline was called Dorothy Returns To Oz. The title changed in August to The Rainbow Road to Oz, and it was largely based on The Patchwork Girl of Oz. Disney realized that his Oz film had become too ambitious a project for television. He announced in November of that same year that a multimillion-dollar live-action musical feature was to start. Bill Walsh was named as producer and Sid Miller as director. Miller wrote songs and musical numbers with Tom Adair and Buddy Baker. To arouse public interest in the project, Disney featured a short Rainbow Road To Oz segment on one of his television shows (The Fourth Anniversary Show of Disneyland on September 11, 1957), which featured two production numbers on three sets, including 120 feet of Yellow Brick Road. Fearing another studio might rush out an Oz film, Disney bought a 12th title from Lippert Pictures, paying almost as much for it as he had for the 11 he already owned. By February 1958, however, the project had died because of Disney's frustrations with the script and designs, and perhaps fear of competing with the 1939 MGM musical, which was gaining renewed popularity via television exposure at that time. Unfortunately, the Disney film was not a box office success, though it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects to Will Vinton, Ian Wingrove, Zoran Perisic, and Michael Lloyd. Released on video in 1985."

The film was based on the novel A Sporting Proposition by James Aldridge, and shot on location in Australia in Victoria and New South Wales. The ideal location for the derelict Pirie farm was found in the Horton Valley, but the nearest towns were 60 miles away, so the cast and crew were divided between Barraba and Bingara.

The small Victorian town of Chiltern was also used as the town of Barambogie, after considerable restoration of the storefronts and pouring tons of earth over the paved roads.

1720,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,a-to-z/snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-film/,"A beautiful girl, Snow White, takes refuge in the forest in the house of Seven Dwarfs to hide from her stepmother, the wicked Queen. The Queen is jealous because she wants to be known as the fairest in the land, and Snow White's beauty surpasses her own. The Dwarfs grow to love their unexpected visitor, who cleans their house and cooks their meals. But one day when they are at their diamond mine, the Queen arrives at the cottage, disguised as an old peddler woman, and she persuades Snow White to bite into a poisoned apple. The Dwarfs, warned by the forest animals, rush home to chase the witch away, but they are too late to save Snow White. They place her in a glass coffin in the woods, and mourn for her. The Prince, who has fallen for Snow White, happens by and awakens her from the wicked Queen's deathlike spell by ""love's first kiss."" Supervising director was David Hand. Premiered on December 21, 1937, at the Carthay Circle Theater in Hollywood, it was the first animated feature film. The film cost $1.4 million, and featured such classic songs as ""Some Day My Prince Will Come,"" Heigh Ho,"" and ""Whistle While You Work."" More than 750 artists worked on the film, which took three years to produce. Of many who auditioned for the voice of Snow White (Walt Disney turned down Deanna Durbin), he chose the young singer Adriana Caselotti. Harry Stockwell, the father of Dean Stockwell, did the voice of the Prince, and many radio and screen personalities were selected for other roles, such as Lucille LaVerne as the Queen and Billy Gilbert as Sneezy. Pinto Colvig (Goofy) did the voices of two of the Dwarfs. Walt had gotten the idea for the film when he was a newsboy in Kansas City, and he saw a major presentation of a silent film version of the story starring Marguerite Clark. The screening was held at the city's Convention Hall in February 1917, and the film was projected onto a four-sided screen using four separate projectors. The movie made a tremendous impression on the 15-year-old viewer because he was sitting where he could see two sides of the screen at once, and they were not quite in sync.The film received a special Academy Award in 1939 consisting of one full-size Oscar and seven dwarf Oscars, presented to Walt Disney by Shirley Temple. For a while after its release, the film became the highest-grossing motion picture of all time, until finally surpassed by Gone With the Wind a couple of years later. This statistic is all the more surprising when one realizes that children were paying a dime to get into the theaters in 1937, and the film, of course, had great appeal to that age group. The original worldwide gross was $8.5 million, a figure that would translate into several hundreds of millions in today's dollars. In England, the film was deemed too scary for children, and those under 16 had to be accompanied by a parent. 83 min. A stage version of the movie played at Radio City Music Hall in New York in 1979. For its 1993 reissue the film was completely restored, being the first ever to be completely digitized by computer, cleaned up, and then printed back to film. The film was reissued eight times, in 1944, 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987, and 1993, and released on video in 1994. In 1978, a 16mm release, Snow White: A Lesson in Cooperation, was released for schools. For the television show on the 1983 reissue, see The Fairest of Them All, and for the one for the 50th Anniversary reissue in 1987, see Golden Anniversary of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."

Filmed in Sequoia National Park and the San Joaquin Valley of California. The train station used on the set had another life after the film was shot.

Kimball was an avid railroad buff who had railroad tracks running down his driveway, and he enjoyed surprising new neighbors by stoking up his full-size locomotive on a Sunday afternoon.

Stars Jason Robards (Charles Halloway), Jonathan Pryce (Mr. Dark), Diane Ladd (Mrs. Nightshade) Pam Grier (Dust Witch), Royal Dano (Tom Fury), Vidal Peterson (Will), Shawn Carson (Jim). The film began life as a short story in a publication called Weird Tales in May 1948, then called ""Black Ferris,"" written by famed science fiction author Ray Bradbury. It became his favorite work and when he saw Gene Kelly's direction of Invitation to a Dance, he personally delivered the story to the star's home in order to work for and with Kelly on a film version of his story. Kelly agreed, but failed to raise the necessary funding. Over the next several years Bradbury converted his screenplay into the novel that was published in 1962 as Something Wicked This Way Comes, and was an immediate, and enduring, best seller. Producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and directors Sam Peckinpah, Mark Rydell, and Steven Spielberg are among those who were associated with the property over the years. Producer Peter Vincent Douglas's fascination with Bradbury's works culminated in a chance meeting with the celebrated author in 1976, in a bookstore, where Douglas discovered the rights to the novel were available again. Acquiring them, he met with director Clayton and over the next several years, they worked on a script. In 1980 Disney production vice president Tom Wilhite expressed an interest in the project, and in September 1981 the production went before the cameras. Green Town was created on the Disney Studio's backlot, after the long-standing generic town square set was bulldozed. It took nearly 200 construction workers to build the one-acre set featuring the elaborate, Victorian-style town. The carnival, a tent, and caravan-lined midway covering two acres was likewise constructed on the Disney lot. Some sequences were shot on location in Vermont to provide the proper atmosphere. Live tarantulas were provided for the movie by Animal Actors of Hollywood, and though they performed dutifully, Studio veterans claim that a few got loose on the lot, causing consternation wherever they turned up. Released on video in 1983."

Allen), and many others from the cast of The Absent-Minded Professor. Walt Disney's grandson, Walter Elias Disney Miller, makes a short appearance as a baby in a television commercial. For the football game in the film, exterior shooting was prohibitive because of the special effects and trick shots involved in the sequence. So, a section of the stadium and a major part of the field were reproduced on one of Disney's largest sound stages. It was exact in every detail, from the transplanted green sod and the goal posts to the cheering spectators and the enthusiastic cheerleaders. Since the team opposing Medfield College was composed of professional football players and not actors, they were surprised to be asked to play indoors. Released on video in 1984."

The film and its songs provided the inspiration for the Splash Mountain attractions in the Disney parks. Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten were Disney's first contract players, since this was the Studio's first major plunge into live-action filmmaking. But since Walt Disney was considered an animated film producer, it was felt that the film should contain at least some animated sequences. Thus, Uncle Remus's stories are shown in animation, along with some clever combinations of the live action and animated characters. The film was reissued in 1956, 1972, 1980, and 1986."

The production took 17 days of principal photography on location in New York City, filming at such landmarks as the Statue of Liberty, the Museum of Natural History and its renowned whale room, Bloomingdale's department store, and Columbus Circle. When Rockefeller Center's ice skating rink closed prematurely for reconstruction, the production was granted permission to build a special rink and film in Central Park. The production then moved to Los Angeles for additional filming at locations throughout Southern California before traveling to the Bahamas for the underwater sequences.

Noted underwater cinematographer Jordan Klein storyboarded each frame of film they would be shooting.

Tex represented the film debuts of both Meg Tilly and Emilio Estevez. The film is based on the novel by S.E. Hinton. Tex was an experiment by the Disney Studio to reach a new generation of teenagers who often abandoned Disney films for more ""realistic"" live-action fare, and this accounts for the PG rating. The movie represents a faithful adaptation of the novel where teen problems are confronted directly and honestly with no easy solutions or false hopes necessarily offered. Aware that Disney was seeking to broaden the content horizon of their films, it was director and screenwriter Tim Hunter who originally recommended Tex to the studio, suggesting Matt Dillon (a fan of Miss Hinton's books, which included The Outsiders) as the lead. Hunter viewed the association between Disney and Hinton as ""a lucky convergence that compromises neither the book nor the studio's high standards for family entertainment.""

When released in 1933, this cartoon not only strengthened Depression-weary audiences, who made the theme song, ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?"" their anthem, but it proved to be another milestone of Disney animation in the scope of characterization, as well as in score and song. Walt Disney entrusted Frank Churchill with the score for the picture and Fred Moore with animating the pigs, and, justifiably proud, said, ""At last we have achieved true personality in a whole picture."" The film became so popular that it often ranked higher on the marquee than the accompanying feature, and often stayed long after feature films came and went. At one New York theater, the manager had beards put on the pigs' faces that grew longer as the short's run extended. One of the most famous cartoons of all time, it won the Academy Award for Best Cartoon. A major merchandising campaign led to many items featuring the Big Bad Wolf and the Three Little Pigs. The film is included in Milestones in Animation (1973). The names of the pigs were Fiddler Pig, Fifer Pig, and Practical Pig.

The idea for Tron grew out of director Lisberger's passion for computer games. He and producer Donald Kushner spent two years researching the technology to make the film, on which he made his live-action directorial debut. The film was the first motion picture to make extensive use of computer imagery, requiring much expertise and imagination. Though computer imagery had been previously seen as an effect in motion pictures such as Star Wars and West World, Tron was the first film to use the technique to create a three-dimensional world. The special effects team was headed by futuristic industrial designer Syd Mead, comic artist ""Moebius"" Giraud, and high-tech commercial artist Peter Lloyd. Harrison Ellenshaw supervised the effects with Richard Taylor. Computer graphics were first applied to aerospace and scientific research in the mid-1960s, when methods of simulating objects digitally in their dimensions proved as effective as building models. The technology was then diverted into the entertainment field. Information International Inc. (Triple-I), Robert Able & Associates of Los Angeles, the Mathematic Applications Group Inc. (MAGI), and Digital Effects of New York produced the computer imagery for the film. MAGI, the single largest contributor of computer imagery, speeded up the process of supplying its work to Disney Studios in Burbank by a trans-continental computer hook-up. The computer link cut between 2 1/2 to 5 days from the creation of each scene. The electronic world was shot on soundstages at the Disney Studio in Burbank. Photography for the real world took place at locations around Los Angeles, and at the U.S. Government's futuristic Lawrence Livermore Laboratory outside Oakland, California. The film was not the box office bonanza the Studio had hoped for, but it did spawn a number of popular video games. Tronwas nominated for an Academy Award for Sound, by Michael, Bob, and Lee Minkler and Jim La Rue, and for Costume Design by Elois Jenssen and Rosanna Norton. Released on video in 1982 and 1993."
